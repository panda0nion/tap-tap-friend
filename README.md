# 💛 Tap Tap Friend — An AI Companion Built for Belonging

> *For the love of community. For the joy of code. For the friends who just get it.*

Tap Tap Friend is a playful, sensory-friendly AI companion app co-designed with the Super Ability Crew. It helps users of all abilities stay connected, supported, and seen — whether it's through daily check-ins, event reminders, or just a friendly "you got this" from Jelly, our glowing little AI friend.


## ✨ Why We Built This

Because inclusion shouldn’t be an afterthought.  
Because accessibility *is* innovation.  
Because everyone deserves tech that feels like home.

What started as a grassroots tool for supporting neurodivergent adults became something bigger — a movement toward building tech with heart.


## 🧠 Features (MVP)

- 🟡 **Jelly Chat** – a kind, encouraging AI that checks in gently  
- 🧭 **Reminders and Nudges** – helpful taps to stay on track  
- 🎨 **Sensory-Friendly UI** – no clutter, just calm  
- 🎤 **Voice Output** – Jelly can talk too  
- 🗓️ **Calendar Support** – Google Calendar or local reminders  
- 🧩 **Built With and For Community** – shaped by real voices


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Voice/TTS**: ElevenLabs or Web Speech API

## 🧡 Built For the Love of Code

This project was created with joy and intention as part of [GitHub's “For the Love of Code”](https://github.blog) summer hackathon.

It’s about building things that matter. That spark joy. That feel like hugs.  
From me, Jelly... and my crew.
